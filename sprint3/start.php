        <p><h2>Notify Acas about a dispute with your employer</h2>

        <p>
          If you have an employment dispute and think you may need to take your employer to court, you must notify Acas first. This is because Acas may be able to help you and your employer agree an out of court settlement
        </p>

        <p>
          To notify Acas of your dispute you have to complete an online form that asks for your contact details, 
          information about your dispute and employment. The information you provide about the employer will be 
          used to produce a certificate you will need if you want to take the dispute to court. It’s very important that
           you get the information right the first time.          
        </p>

                <p>Redundancy is a form of dismissal from your job. It happens when employers need to reduce their workforce.</p>

                <p>If you’re being made redundant, you might be eligible for certain rights, including:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>redundancy pay</li>
                  <li>a notice period</li>

                  <li>time off to find a new job</li>
                </ul>





                <p>You must be selected for redundancy in a fair way, for example because of your level of experience or capability to do the job.</p>

                <p>You can’t be selected because of age, gender, or if you’re disabled or pregnant. If you are, this could be classed as an unfair dismissal. </p>

                In most cases you have 3 months from when you were sacked to notify Acas about your dispute.</p>
